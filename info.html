<h1>I am a <strike>[typographic/interaction/product]</strike> designer in San Francisco.</h1>

<p>I am the Principal Designer at <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> where I lead the design of key initiatives across the Twitter product. I am also an Advisor/Mentor at <a href="http://designerfund.com/">The Designer Fund</a>, whose mission is to invest in designers who create businesses with positive social impact. I am the co-creator <a href="http://52weeksofux.com">52 Weeks of UX</a>, an online resource created to provide “discourse on the process of designing for real people.”</p>

<p>I also have a serious infatuation with typography&mdash;especially web typography&mdash;and created a couple little tools that hopefully make the world a better place, typographically speaking. I built <a href="http://ffffallback.com/">Ffffallback</a> to help people create bulletproff font-stacks and <a href="http://responsivemeasure.com">Responsive Measure</a> as a way to connect responsive designs to an ideal measure.</p>

<p>I have been incredibly blessed to work with amazing people on some amazing products. This year, Fast Company named me one of <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670700/50-designers-shaping-the-future-part-1#1"><em>50 Designers shaping the future of Design</em></a>, which I consider a win for designers everywhere who roll up their sleeves, do the work, and sweat the details.</p>
